![MQTT](https://img.shields.io/badge/MQTT-Protocol-yellowgreen.svg)

A real-time exercise tracking system that uses computer vision and deep learning to detect and count various exercises. Built with TensorFlow, Flask, and MQTT for IoT integration.

## 🎯 Features

- **Real-time Exercise Detection**: Uses MobileNetV2 for efficient, accurate exercise classification
- **Motion Analysis**: Tracks user movement and provides feedback on form
- **Exercise Counting**: Automatically counts repetitions for supported exercises
- **IoT Integration**: MQTT protocol for real-time data transmission
- **Web Dashboard**: Interactive interface for exercise monitoring

## 📊 Dashboard Preview

The dashboard provides real-time statistics and exercise counts, including:
- Individual exercise counters
- Pie chart showing exercise distribution
- Historical exercise data
- Motion status monitoring
- Form quality feedback

## 🏗 Architecture

### Node Red Flow
![Architecture Diagram](images/flow.png)

he system utilizes Node-RED for real-time exercise state processing and counting. Here's how the flow works:

1. **Exercise State Input (MQTT)**
   - Subscribes to `fitness/exercise_state` topic
   - QoS level 1 for reliable message delivery
   - Receives JSON payloads with exercise state and motion data

2. **State Processing (Function Node)**
   - Tracks previous and current exercise states
   - Implements rep counting logic based on motion transitions
   - Maintains exercise counts in flow context
   - Exercise types: jumping_jack, bicep_curl, plank, lunge, pushup

3. **Data Publishing**
   - Sends exercise counts to ThingsBoard via MQTT
   - Topic: `v1/devices/me/telemetry`
   - Includes timestamp and individual exercise counts

4. **Reset Functionality**
   - Manual reset capability via inject node
   - Resets all exercise counters to zero
   - Broadcasts reset event to ThingsBoard

### Flow Configuration
```json
{
  "mqtt_broker": {
    "local": {
      "url": "localhost",
      "port": 1883,
      "protocol": "mqtt"
    },
    "thingsboard": {
      "url": "mqtt.thingsboard.cloud",
      "port": 1883,
      "protocol": "mqtt"
    }
  }
}
```

### Web Interface

The web interface features:
- Live video feed with exercise detection
- Start/Stop detection controls
- Real-time exercise status
- Motion status indicator
- Form quality feedback
